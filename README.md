## Python Challenges: PyBank and PyPoll

### Background

In this assignment, I completed two Python challenges, PyBank and PyPoll. These tasks presented real-world situations where Python scripting skills were utilized.

### Before You Begin

Before starting the assignment, I completed the following steps:

* Created a new repository for this project called python-challenge.
* Cloned the new repository to my computer.
* Created a folder for each Python assignment named PyBank and PyPoll.
* Added the following content to each folder:
  A new file called main.py, the main script to run for each analysis.
A Resources folder containing the CSV files used, ensuring that the script has the correct path to the CSV file.
An analysis folder containing the text file with the results from the analysis.


## PyBank Instructions

In the PyBank challenge, I was tasked with creating a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company. The dataset, budget_data.csv, consisted of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses". The script calculates the following values:

* Total number of months included in the dataset
* Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* Changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and the average of those changes
* Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyPoll Instructions

In the PyPoll challenge, I was tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process. The dataset, election_data.csv, consisted of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate". The script calculates the following values:

* Total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote
